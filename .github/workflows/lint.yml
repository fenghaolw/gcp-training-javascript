# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the main/master branch
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ] # Adjust to your default branch
  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events to any branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ '**' ] # Runs on all branches for PRs

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "lint"
  lint:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # You can choose other runners like windows-latest or macos-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # It's good practice to use the latest version

      # ** IMPORTANT: This is where you'll add the setup and linting command specific to your project **
      # Example for a generic Node.js project with ESLint (replace with your linter)
